Subject: [PATCH 17/20] nova usage-list not reporting the proper
 usage values     This is upstream bug related to usage-list pagination
 feature     The logic of original code for assembly of paged usage-list    
 is problematic. The usages dict has been populated with full     list of
 usages data.  However, each suequential page with     usage info is
 continuously added to the usages which caused     duplication of usage data
 except the fist page. Therefore     the fix here is to populate the initial
 usages dict with only     the first page of usage data
